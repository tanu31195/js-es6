# OOP in JavaScript

OOP is a programming paradigm centered around **objects** rather than functions  
Combines group of related variables(properties) and functions(methods) into a unit called object

Four pillars of OOP are,  

1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

Grouping of related variables(properties) and functions(methods) together  
Reduces complexity and increases reusability  

## Abstraction

Hide the details and complexity and present only the essentials to the outside  
Reduces complexity and isolate the impact of changes  

## Inheritance

Can have a generic object so other objects can inherit the properties and methods  
Allows to eliminate redundant code  

## Polymorphism

Allows to have many forms
Can share or override behavior
